# OCLC-Serials-Holdings-Changes
Process for identifying changes in serials holdings for upload into OCLC Worldshare Knowledge Base.  Compares reports of holdings for two consecutive months to identify additions, changes, and deletions.

Two JSON scripts: one designed to identify additions and changes; the other to identify deletions.
The scripts are still currently being refined for processing efficiencies.
